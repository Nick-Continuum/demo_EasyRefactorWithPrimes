# Prime Number Project

## Description of the problem.
We want to create a program that will break down a number into its prime factors.

Every number can be written by a multiplication of prime numbers. 
This is very useful when we want to simplify multiple mathematical operations.  
For example, 
- 12 = 2 * 2 * 3.
- 15 = 3 * 5.
- 28 = 2 * 2 * 7.
- 100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5.
- 12548125 = 5 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17.

We want to create a program that will take a number and return its prime factors for further use.

```BASH
What number needs to be disected: 12
calculating...
Result: 2 * 2 * 3
```
